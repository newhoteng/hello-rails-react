# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
  messages = Message.create([{ text: "Hello React" }, { text: "Hello Rails" }, { text: "Hello Rails-React" }, { text: "Hello Microverse" }, { text: "Hello Module 6" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)
